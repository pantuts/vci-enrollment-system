                Veritas College of Irosin has its own histories which identifies who were involved in the efforts undertaken in order to reach the goals it aimed to achieve.<br/><br/>
                In1983, Mayor Roque G. Dorotan of Irosin approached the Sister Servant of the Holy Spirit to re-open the tertiary level of the College of the Holy Spirit of Irosin which was previously closed due to lack of enrollee’s. She refused. He went to Msgr. Jesus Y. Varela for advice but the latter replied that opening a school needs a lot of money.<br/><br/>
                With the closure of Divine Word College in Sorsogon that year, Msgr. Eladio T. Places, its head, was willing to manage the desired college in Irosin if Mr. Dorotan could raise the amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php 150,000.00) as starting capital. With the assurance of help he went back to Irosin. With the help of his wife, Mrs. Esperanza Uy Dorotan who was then the Treasurer of the Parish Pastoral Council (PPC), together with Msgr. Elias Pura, Jr. and other officers of the PPC, the group went around the town of Irosin. The group solicited donations from the good citizens of the community. With this amount plus the books and other educational materials of Msgr. Eladio T. Places, Veritas College of Irosin was organized and the latter was the first Director.<br/><br/>
                The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 15, 1987 under SEC Registration no. 142489. This declared the school as non-stock and non-profit catholic school with new name VERITAS College of Irosin. Its original incorporators were:<br/><br/>
                1.Bishop Jesus Y. Varela, D.D.–Bishop of the Diocese of Sorsogon<br/>
                2.Msgr. Eladio T. Palces, HP – Director of VCI<br/>
                3.Msgr. Elias Pura, Jr., HP – Irosin Parish Priest<br/>
                4.Atty. Haile F. Frivaldo – Director of HTCC<br/>
                5.Asteria B. Elegado – President of CWL – Irosin Unit<br/>
                The Original Board of Trustee as approved was:<br/>
                1. Msgr. Eladio T. Palces<br/>
                2. Msgr. Elias Pura Jr.<br/>
                3. Mr. Adolfo Cielo<br/>
                4. Mr. Roque G. Dorotan<br/>
                5. Mr. Ramon Dreu<br/>
                6. Mr. Arcadio Glipo<br/>
                7. Mr. Roger Perez<br/><br/>
                In the first year of operation SY 1985- 1986 Veritas College of Irosin had only One Hundred (100) students. In 1987- 1988, draught and two strong typhoons wrought much damage to agricultural products in Irosin. The enrolment dwindled from One Hundred Fifty One (151) to ninety five (95) although the tuition fee then was only Twenty Five (Php25) per unit. The initial courses were DAT, AB and Secretarial.<br/><br/>
                In July 25, 1994. Rev. Fr. Elias F. Escanilla was designated as the second College Director replacing Msgr. Palces. It was then that buildings were renovated, the school compound fenced and new facilities were installed.<br/><br/>
                In July 1996-1997, Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED) and Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSE) were approved. The enrolment rose to Three Hundred One (301). The Administration hired qualified and experienced teachers to work as fulltime and part time instructors in 1997 to 2000, the school population rose to Five hundred Seventy Five. Additional buildings and facilities were provided as vocational courses, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, and Bachelor of Science in Criminology were opened. With this tremendous increase in enrolment, additional books, computers, typewriters, mechanical tools and gadgets and other facilities were procured.<br/><br/>
                On March 21, 2009. Rev. Fr. Elias F. Escanilla was replaced by Rev. Fr. Cecil Datar as OIC VCI Director. On the May 12, 2009 BOT Meeting held at the House of the Clergy, the Chairman introduced the incoming president of VCI. Rev. Fr. Odine L. Areola. On June 2, 2009 BOT Meeting Rev. Fr. Odine Areola was formally appointed VCI President. The other officers of the new BOT were likewise appointed.<br/><br/>
                The following school year, the President embarked on a big project, the three (3) story school building as approved by the BOT in coordination with the school faculty, staff and student. Additional school facilities were procured. VCI acquired legally the 25 hectares Demo Form in Gulang – Gulang Irosin.<br/><br/>
                Last AY 2012 – 2013 there was a tremendous increase in enrolment numbering 1,018 students. At present AY 2013 – 2014 the enrolment further rose to 1,423. The good performance of VCI graduates in passing Board and Career Exams of Civil Service encouraged parents from Irosin and some neighboring towns to send their children to VCI for their college education. The current board of trustee and the College Director Rev. Fr. Odine Areola with its faculty and staff are doing their best to produce graduates who are equipped with the values, knowledge and skills competitive enough for the present needs of our times. The school looks forward to the continued support and patronage of the people for which the organizer and the present management desire, to serve – the parents, the people of God and the youth of Irosin and neighboring towns in the Province of Sorsogon.
